## **1.	High-Level Summary**

GoodSecurity was tasked with performing an internal penetration test on GoodCorp’s CEO, Hans Gruber. 
An internal penetration test is a dedicated attack against internally connected systems. 
The goal of this test is to perform attacks similar to those of a hacker and attempt to infiltrate Hans’ computer to determine if it is at risk. 
GoodSecurity’s overall objective was to exploit any vulnerable software, find a secret recipe file on Hans’ computer, and report the findings back to GoodCorp.
The internal penetration test found several alarming vulnerabilities on Hans’ computer: 
When performing the attacks, GoodSecurity was able to gain access to his machine and find the secret recipe file by exploiting two programs with major vulnerabilities. 
The details of the attack are below.

## **2.	Findings**

Machine IP:192.168.0.20

Hostname:MSEDGEWIN10

Vulnerability Exploited:Icecast Header Overwrite

### **Vulnerability Explanation:**

This vunerability works on Icecast versions of 2.0.1 and earlier.  
It exploits a buffer overflow in the header parsing by sending 32 HTTP headers, 
writing one past the end of the pointer array.

### **Severity:**

This is highly severe and enabled direct access to files on the machine that were able to be exfiltrated.
